Final project Idea:

Summary:
I would like to create a website where parents/caretakers can rent baby/children's items.
They would be able to search for what they need, select an amount of time they will need
to rent the gear, pay on the site and have it shipped to them. A stretch goal may be to
have a forum for questions, suggestions, etc.

Users: parents/caretakers of babies and younger children.

Solving a problem: After having my first child I was blown away by how necessary some items
are for such a short amount of time. Many of the items we received as gifts were barely used
and I have been able to pass them on to other friends to use with their little ones. This site would
provide gently used gear (Rock and Plays, bouncers, Bumbos, swings, bassinets, etc.) at an affordable
price and not clutter up someone's home because they don't know what to do with it once their child does not
need it anymore.

File structure: Along with the normal files we have worked with so far (src and dist) I know that I
think I will need some type of inventory structure in place but am not sure what that would look like.

Design Concerns/objectives: I think that the site should have a feel that is somewhere between flashy and minimalist.
The site must be easy to navigate and search so that users are able to find what they need but should also
be attractive to the eye so people want to come back.

Data Storage: User storage will be important for small profile creation types of things.
The biggest chunk of storage would come from inventory data.

Page Look: Since the primary function of the site will be images of products I think the general Page
structure should be relatively simple so as not to distract. There may be some more flashiness on
the individual user pages/profiles.
