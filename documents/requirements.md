Final project Idea:

Summary:
I would like to create a website where parents/caretakers can rent baby/children's items.
They would be able to search for what they need, select an amount of time they will need
to rent the gear, pay on the site and have it shipped to them. I have not yet decided if it would be
people posting their own items for rental or a full fledged company structure with inventory.
A stretch goal may be to have a forum for questions, suggestions, etc.

Users: parents/caretakers of babies and younger children. Or anyone in need of baby/children's gear.

Solving a problem: After having my first child I was blown away by how necessary some items
are for such a short period of time. Many of the items we received as gifts were barely used
and I have been able to pass them on to other friends to use with their little ones. This site would
provide gently used gear (Rock and Plays, bouncers, Bumbos, swings, bassinets, etc.) at an affordable
price and not clutter up someone's home because they don't know what to do with it once their child does not
need it anymore. I was lucky to have so many people in my life who bought gifts or passed things along but
not everyone has that luxury. This site would provide these items for the short amount of time
they are needed without having to pay full price for something that your child may not even like. Everyone
told us we HAD to have a swing. Babies love them. My kid HATED the swing and it sat in our living room
taking up space until I was able to pass it on to an expecting friend.

File structure: Along with the normal files we have worked with so far (src and dist) I know that I
think I will need some type of inventory structure in place but am not sure what that would look like.
This is an area that I will need to research more and will flesh out as we learn more about back-end
systems.

Design Concerns/objectives: I think that the site should have a feel that is somewhere between flashy and minimalist.
The site must be easy to navigate and search so that users are able to find what they need but should also
be attractive to the eye so people want to come back. I envision some type of hybrid between the
simple/semi-boring/totally awful look of Craigslist and the elegant minimalism of Facebook. Since there
will be user profiles and a searchable databases I think the "less is more" approach will be appropriate.

Page Look: Since the primary function of the site will be images of products I think the general Page
structure should be relatively simple so as not to distract. There may be some more flashiness on
the individual user pages/profiles but not too much.

Data Storage: User storage will be important for small profile creation types of things.
The biggest chunk of storage would come from inventory data. I am excited to learn more about databases
as we continue on to see how this will become a reality for my project.
